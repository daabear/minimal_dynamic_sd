In foreign policy, we have reached agreements with the Western powers and the <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span> that might make genuine peace a reality. <br><br> Now, the task of <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democracy</span> is to prepare for the next election. The <span style="color: #000000;">bourgeois</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> government of Wilhelm Marx is unpopular, and we stand to gain.

Stresemann is growing disillusioned with his own party, viewing it as a vehicle for industrial interests rather than liberal values. The leftists in the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> argue that the merger would have to take into account the interests of the working class, a policy vehemently opposed by the industrial interests. ?]{!</p>!}
