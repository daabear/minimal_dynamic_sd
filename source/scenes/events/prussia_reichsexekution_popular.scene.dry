= Coup in Prussia

A crisis! President [+ president +] has invoked the *Reichsexekution* to dismiss the Prussian government, citing its "inability to maintain order" amidst escalating clashes between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, Reichsbanner, and the increasingly militant <span style="color: #700000;">**RFB**</span>. However, the true motivation is clear: the left-wing coalition governing Prussia poses a direct threat to the conservative and nationalist establishment in Germany.

The legality of this action remains highly questionable. The left-wing coalition has vowed to resist, while the streets are descending into chaos with mass protests and rising political violence.

subtitle: Labor will call a general strike. The Reichsbanner and the loyal elements of the Prussian police will resist the coup. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> remains unwavering in its support.

The Reichswehr and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> are already surrounding Berlin, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is supporting them. This could be civil war. We do realize that, correct? 

- @defend_2: We will fight, even if it leads to a civil war.

Our combined forces confront the government troops and their <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> auxiliaries, and somehow, our enemies retreat without a fight! They were overwhelmed by our display of strength, and have chosen to slink away. President [+ president +] withdraws the dismissal of the Prussian government, at least for now.

The show of force has reinvigorated support for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, and has weakened the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>.

@defend_2_civil_war

Our forces confront the government troops and their supporters on the streets of Berlin, and armed fighting erupts. The <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span> do not budge from their positions. We are caught at a disadvantage.

- @civil_war: It is a civil war.

The <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span> who resist are brutally suppressed, and without the support of the Reichsbanner, we are forced to surrender the Prussian government to the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>. A pall of hopelessness and despair descends over <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democracy</span>. We have failed. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> will never trust us again. Many in the Reichsbanner simply quit, demoralized by their leaders' lack of a call to action.

Hindenburg appoints the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> Franz von Papen to govern over Prussia as a *Reichskommissar*, charged with dismantling the democratic systems we worked hard to build.
