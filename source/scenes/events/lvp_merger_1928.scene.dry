= <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> Congress

Stresemann has called an emergency party congress within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> over the contentious issue of a merger with <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>. The Liberal Association has already made significant strides in laying the groundwork for a <span style="color: #FFCC00;">united liberal party</span>, including the creation of a national framework and the drafting of a middle-class-oriented policy platform broadly supported by both parties.

However, the right wing of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, led by Ernst Scholz, remains the final stumbling block towards a <span style="color: #FFCC00;">united liberal party</span>. They are determined to oppose the merger, wielding their substantial influence over the party and industrialists to rally against it.

The momentum towards liberal unity has proven too great for the few holdouts within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s right wing to stand against. The party has officially voted to approve the merger with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, who have also done the same. Both parties will now work together to establish the framework of the new <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span>.
