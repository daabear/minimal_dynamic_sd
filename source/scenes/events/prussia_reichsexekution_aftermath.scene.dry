= Prussian Elections Restored?

It has been a year since President Hindenburg dismissed the Prussian government, and hopefully the situation is stable enough for new elections to be called.

As expected, the democratic process returns to the state of Prussia and Papen has called new elections.

New Prussian elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].
