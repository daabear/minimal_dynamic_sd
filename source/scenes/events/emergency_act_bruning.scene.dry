= Act for the Protection of the Economy and Finance

To eliminate the growing deficit in the national budget, Brüning has introduced an act that enforces sweeping government spending cuts while implementing a special “crisis tax” and raising various other taxes. To justify the hardships imposed on German society, Brüning coupled its promulgation with a public appeal, urging Germany’s international creditors to acknowledge the sacrifices demanded of the German people by providing relief from the nation’s “intolerable” reparations burden.

The act is deeply unpopular, provoking widespread outrage across German society and fueling the intense agitation from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> against the bourgeois parties, pressuring them to break with Brüning over the matter. The [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> are?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> is?] particularly affected, as they're the parties representing the social groups most impacted by these changes. Brüning's failure to consult [? if not lvp_formed:either party?][? if lvp_formed:them?] before introducing the bill has left the [? if not lvp_formed:liberal parties?][? if lvp_formed: liberals?] powerless to amend some of the most severe provisions, such as cuts to civil servants' salaries and an increase in the national sales tax.

With the bourgeois-right holding a majority coalition, it is now up to them to resolve their differences if they wish to prevent their government from collapsing.

The [? if not lvp_formed:<span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: right <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> have broken with Brüning, voting against the act when it came to a vote in the Reichstag. However, this decision has ignited fierce internal divisions within both parties. A significant pro-Brüning faction—including figures like Westarp, [? if not lvp_formed: Curtius?][? if lvp_formed: Dietrich?], and several influential industrialists such as Hans Luther—pushed for continued support, convincing a sizable minority in both parties to back the act as the bitter medicine for Germany’s economic woes.

Despite these divisions, when the [? if not lvp_formed:<span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed:<span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?] introduced a vote of no confidence, defectors from both parties tipped the scales, narrowly bringing down Brüning’s government. New elections have been scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

This sparked fierce internal divisions within both parties, as a strong pro-Brüning faction—including figures like Westarp, [? if not lvp_formed: Curtius?][? if lvp_formed: Dietrich?], and several influential industrialists such as Hans Luther—argued for continued support, persuading their colleagues to back the act as a necessary, albeit painful, remedy for Germany’s economic woes.

As a result, the planned vote of no confidence has been shelved, allowing the bourgeois-right government to survive—albeit with its unity hanging by a thread.
