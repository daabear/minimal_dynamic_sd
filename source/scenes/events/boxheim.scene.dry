= The Boxheim Documents

In the elections in the State of Hesse, which resulted in no clear majority, we have remained in a caretaker capacity. [? if z_ideology == "Right": while the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> attempt to negotiate a coalition agreement.?] This has allowed us to retain control of the Interior Ministry and granted our Wilhelm Leuschner, the authority to order house searches of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> following a tip from a disgraced <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> Landtag member.

During these searches, a copy of a letter sent by <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> member Werner Best to the party leadership in Munich is discovered. The letter reveals their plan to violently seize power and includes guidelines for emergency decrees. Among these plans is a provision making access to food contingent on compulsory labor service, from which <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span> would be exempt, implying they would receive no food at all.

In an attempt to protect themselves from the severe damage this revelation causes to [? if not hitler_deported: Hitler's?][? if hitler_deported: their?] oath of legality, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> has defended the letter, claiming it was intended solely for a potential <span style="color: #700000;">communist</span> seizure of power. It is now up to the judiciary to determine the consequences of this anti-constitutional plan.

Due to our thorough reform of the judicial system, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> behind these documents can now be publicly exposed and prosecuted by the state for high treason. This has dealt a severe blow to the constitutional appearance of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, causing great distrust between them and the bourgeois establishment, including President Hindenburg himself.

Our Hesse government is set to continue in a caretaker capacity for the foreseeable future, following the collapse of talks between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>.

Expectedly, the Ministry of Justice believes that the documents did not constitute a crime of high treason, as they argue that the document was directed against <span style="color: #700000;">communist</span> putschists, rather than the government.

We have at least discredited the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in the eyes of many, and have managed to keep our Hesse government functioning in a caretaker capacity due to the collapse of talks between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> and <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>.
