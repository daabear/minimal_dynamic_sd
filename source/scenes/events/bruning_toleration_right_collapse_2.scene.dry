= The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> breaks with Brüning

The continued rise of the <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> following the failed attempt of more radical <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> members to bring down the Brüning government has forced even the most pro-Brüning politicians to reconsider their prior decision.

President [+ president +] has allowed Brüning to reshuffle his cabinet, replacing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>-affiliated ministers with bourgeois ones. At least this is a step up from what we had previously.

go-to: new_prussia_election if (in_center_right_coalition_prussia or in_right_coalition_prussia)

President [+ president +], tired of this instability, has forced Brüning's resignation to pave the way for new elections, hoping that the gains of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #003755;">opposition</span> will persuade him to enter a coalition with them.

The <span style="color: #000000;">bourgeois</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> coalition has fallen. New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

on-arrival: prussia_coalition_trigger = 1

The Prussian coalition isn't able to survive either, pressure from the national conservatives within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> forces them to exit from the <span style="color: #000000;">bourgeois</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> coalition there as well.

- @prussian_coalition_formation: Negotiate a new Prussian coalition.
