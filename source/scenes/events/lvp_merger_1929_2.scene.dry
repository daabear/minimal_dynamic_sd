=  <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> Congress

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> has made its decision in favor of merging the two parties; now, the fate of the unification rests with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">[+ ddp_name +]</span>. The most prominent proponents within the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> in favor of the merger are those in the business wing, who have pursued this goal for years.

On the other hand, leftists within the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> strongly oppose the merger citing obvious concerns, as well as those who favor a potential merger with the <span style="color: #D3D3A9;">**VNR**</span> instead. A defeat in this decision would spell the end of liberal cooperation for the foreseeable future, severely demoralizing the German middle class, with the blame falling on the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>.

on-arrival: ddp_relation -= 3; ddp_right += 1.5; lvp_trigger_1_time = time + 1

As expected, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> has followed the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s decision and affirmed their support for a united <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span>. 

However, the leftists within the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> will wield little influence in the wider party, which will consist of twice as many <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> members as <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> members.

Surprisingly, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> have rejected the plans to create a united <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span>. It seems that the infighting that plagues the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> remains alive and well. This outcome has greatly demoralized the German middle and has forced the disbandment of the Liberal Association.
