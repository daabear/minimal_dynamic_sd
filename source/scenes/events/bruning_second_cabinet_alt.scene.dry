= The Second Brüning cabinet

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s Julius Curtius has resigned from the Foreign Ministry following the disastrous failure of the Austro-German customs union, which he was the architect of. With no more <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> ministers in cabinet, the last obstacle preventing them from breaking with Brüning's government has been removed. In an attempt to maintain their support, Brüning has formed a more conservative second cabinet, which the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> reluctantly accepts, considering the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> have no interest in entering government.

We must now decide whether to continue tolerating this more right-leaning Brüning government—now absent of leftist figures such as the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>’s Joseph Wirth—or to finally use this as a pretext to break away from it.

We have officially broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, voting against them in a vote of no confidence. Continuing to support such a government would go against all our values. The bourgeois parties have also joined in, choosing to cut their losses rather than engage in a futile attempt to save Brüning’s government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

We are compelled once again to vote in favor of the [+ chancellor +] government to prevent the extremist parties on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">left</span> from translating their growing popular support into parliamentary gains.

Despite the new right-wing cabinet, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> is still refusing to support Brüning, as they want all the power to themselves.
