= Second Emergency Decree for Economy and Finance

Intended to eliminate the growing deficit in the national budget, the emergency decree enacts sweeping cuts to government spending while introducing a special “crisis tax” and raising various other taxes. To justify the hardships imposed on German society, Brüning coupled its promulgation with a public appeal, urging Germany’s international creditors to acknowledge the sacrifices demanded of the German people by providing relief from the nation’s “intolerable” reparations burden.

The decree is deeply unpopular, provoking widespread outrage across German society and fueling the intense agitation from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> against the bourgeois parties that still haven't split from Brüning's government, particularly the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], as they're the [? if not lvp_formed:parties?][? if lvp_formed:party?] representing the social groups most impacted by these changes. Brüning's failure to consult [? if not lvp_formed:either party?][? if lvp_formed:them?] beforehand has left the [? if not lvp_formed:liberal parties?][? if lvp_formed: liberals?] powerless to amend some of the most severe provisions, such as cuts to civil servants' salaries and an increase in the national sales tax. [? if not lvp_formed and not bourgeois_parliament and not liberal_parliament: The already fragile alliance between the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and Brüning appears to be on the verge of collapse—an outcome that could seal the fate of his government. ?]
