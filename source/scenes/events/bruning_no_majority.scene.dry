= Brüning's government collapses!

The defection of multiple bourgeois and special interest parties from their previously unwavering support for the Brüning government has left the cabinet without a majority, even with our toleration. [? if not second_bruning_cabinet_seen: Brüning himself continues to resist forming a more right-wing cabinet to appease the defectors, believing that at least one of them will waver in the face of the political and economic instability that would follow. ?]

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> remains committed to its all-or-nothing approach, refusing to support the government unless they are granted the Chancellery. Despite this, many on the Right still believe that a compromise with Hitler and Hugenberg is possible and believe that Brüning is not making enough of an effort to achieve it.

We have officially broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, voting against them in a vote of no confidence. The bourgeois parties have also joined in, rather than engage in a futile attempt to save Brüning’s government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span> has unexpectedly reversed its opposition to Brüning's government following last-minute concessions from the Chancellor. In a crucial no-confidence vote, they sided with the government, effectively canceling out the impact of the other bourgeois parties that voted against it.

This sudden shift by the <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span> has all but sealed its political demise. Already struggling to maintain support among the middle class, the party now faces mass defections, with local chapters either dissolving or breaking away entirely.

Despite the formation of a more right-leaning cabinet, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">national</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">opposition</span> remains unwilling to support Brüning, as they seek to claim full control for themselves.

We are once again compelled to vote in favor of the [+ chancellor +] government to prevent the extremist parties on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">left</span> from translating their growing popular support into parliamentary gains.

Unfortunately, all efforts to save the government have been in vain. Only [+ bruning_coalition +]% of the Reichstag voted to support Brüning’s government. As a result, new elections have been scheduled for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
