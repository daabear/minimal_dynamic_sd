= Exodus from the Reichsbanner

The Reichsbanner has become increasingly militarized as of late, with ever-greater quantities of arms and paramilitary training, as well as a stream of <span style="color: #9B0000;">radicalized</span> <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> members. In response, the members associated with the other <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> parties, the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], are threatening to leave for good. They signed up for a mass movement to defend the republic, not a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> militia.

- @let_go: Let the <span style="color: #000000;">centrists</span> and [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">liberals</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberals</span>?] go.
- @lower_militancy: We must lower the Reichsbanner's militancy.
- @keep_them: Can we convince them that a militant Reichsbanner is necessary for defending the Republic?

@let_go
on-arrival: rb_strength *= 0.9; z_relation -= 5; ddp_relation -= 5; lvp_relation -= 5; rb_exit = 1; left_strength += 5*(1-dissent); ddp_right += 3; lvp_right += 3

We have judged that the Reichsbanner's militancy is more important than maintaining a coalition with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?]. The Reichsbanner members affiliated with these parties leave, while the left of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is strengthened.

# TODO: this should make it harder to form Weimar coalitions


@lower_militancy
on-arrival: rb_militancy *= 0.5

Bowing to the other parties' demands, we reduce the Reichsbanner's military training, thus inducing them to stay.

on-arrival: rb_stay = 1; ddp_left += 2; ddp_cohesion += 2; lvp_left += 2

Seeing the strife that has filled Germany's streets, the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] seem to be convinced that it is necessary for the Reichsbanner to be militarized, and will not leave the organization.
