= <span style="color: #003755;">Deutschnationale Front</span> founded

Hugenberg and his supporters have went through with his plans to organize a secession from the right of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> and formed his own political party, the <i>Deutschnationale Front</i> (<span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span>). Hugenberg has brought a considerable amount of party infrastructure into his own splinter party, however, it doesn't appear like the <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span> would have much electoral appeal as the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> paramilitary is caught between the two parties, but doesn't pledge support for either one. It may take some time until the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> rebuilds to fill the hole Hugenberg's influence left behind.

The <span style="color: #385A38;">agrarian</span>, industrialist, <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Socialist</span>, and the new 'Young Conservative' wings of the parties have largely remained in the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, and will hopefully change their attitude towards the republic. The small <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> has gained among some radicalized <span style="color: #003755;">**DNF**</span> supporters.

The right has been considerably weakened, now is our chance to enact meaningful change without their disruption.
