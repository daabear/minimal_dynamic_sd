= Chancellor [+ chancellor +] Sacked

President Hindenburg has made his dissatisfaction with the <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> presence in government clear and has used his presidential powers to remove us by force. It seems like this decision wasn't a rash one, but rather a matter of finding the appropriate pretext to dismiss our government.

[? if unemployed >= 15 or economic_growth < 0: Germany's economic crisis and our inadequate response have severely tested Hindenburg's patience, as he favors an austerity-driven approach. ?][? if nsdap_votes >= 18: The rapid rise of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> in local elections has pushed Hindenburg to appoint a government more in line with the national mood. ?][? if rearmament_exposed or reichswehr_loyalty <= 0.1: Kurt von Schleicher and the Reichswehr, outraged by our actions, have leveraged their influence over Hindenburg to push for our removal. ?][? if capital_strike_progress >= 5: Business leaders, frustrated by our policies, have pressured Hindenburg’s inner circle to act against us. ?]

This is a blatant violation of democracy, but we are powerless to stop it. Our only hope is to rally enough support in the next election to reclaim our mandate.

Brüning immediately begins to cut welfare using his emergency powers granted by President [+ president +]. We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.
