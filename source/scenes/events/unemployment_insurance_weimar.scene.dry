= Unemployment Insurance Crisis

The economic crisis has caused mass layoffs all throughout Germany, affecting the industrial working class the hardest. Our welfare spending is increasing due to the greater need.

In the midst of all this, our unemployment insurance program is underfunded; the program was never budgeted for this much unemployment. We have to either increase funding or cut benefits.

- @cut_benefits: Cut benefits.
- @increase_employers: Increase employer contributions.
- @balance: Increase both employer and employee contributions.

For budgetary reasons, we have cut unemployment insurance benefits. Unfortunately, our reasons for fiscal discipline are alien to the workers. They are furious at our betrayal, as are a good portion of our membership throughout the factions. Our loss is the <span style="color: #700000 ;">**KPD**</span>'s gain, and even the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>, those lapdogs of the bourgeoisie, have joined in criticizing us for our austerity.

We have increased employer contributions to the unemployment insurance fund, allowing the program to continue without hurting workers and the unemployed. Perhaps understandably, the capitalists and their political parties are furious, while our base in the unions and among the unemployed are pleased.

Neither side is entirely satisfied by our compromise solution. Many of the workers and unemployed see this as a betrayal, although we present it as the successful aversion of a much worse alternative.
