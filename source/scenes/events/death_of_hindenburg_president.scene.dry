= The Death of Hindenburg

President Paul von Hindenburg has passed away at age 86. An era of history is closing, and the future remains to be seen.

The nation engages in an outpouring of grief for its war hero and president, with even some sympathy among committed <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">icans</span> and <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span>. After all, Hindenburg steered the republic through some of its most challenging times, without giving in to extremists on the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. Perhaps he is one reason democracy remains alive.

New presidential elections are to be held as soon as possible. The German political landscape is wide open, with contenders from all over the political space. In the meantime, Supreme Court chief justice [? if judicial_reform < 4 : Erwin Bumke ?][? if judicial_reform >= 4 : Hermann Großmann ?] serves as the acting president.

# Hermann Großmann is the supreme court chief justice in judicial reform.

- @candidates: Who are the candidates so far?

@candidates
go-to: candidate_menu

[? if not hitler_deported : Of course, Adolf Hitler will be running for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>, in his third run. We have kept him out of power so far, but nothing is certain. ?]
[? if hitler_deported : With Hitler deported, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> will be running Hermann Göring as their candidate. ?]
This might be the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span>' last hurrah; the party's internal contradictions are heightening, and it is in desperate shortage of funds.

The <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> will nominate Franz Seldte, leader of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> paramilitary group. He will be endorsed by many of Hindenburg's most right-wing supporters. They are working more closely with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> than before, and in the second round, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> parties are expected to consolidate into a single anti-<span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> front.

[? if kpd_leader = "Conciliators" : Given the failure of Thälmann's previous runs for president, and his declining stature in the party, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> will be running Willi Münzenberg, a controversial figure sometimes called the "Red millionaire". He is a media magnate who leads a number of <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span> front organizations. ?]
[? if kpd_leader != "Conciliators" : This will be Ernst Thälmann's third run for president as leader of the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>. Despite his previous electoral defeats, he retains the loyalty of the party as well as <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalin</span>'s <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span>. ?]

Many <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">icans</span> of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, and <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> float the idea of running Hugo Eckener, a nationally renowed Zeppelin captain, as a unity candidate. While he has some nationalistic views, he is also ardently opposed to <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>.

Barring that, the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> are planning to run separate candidates in the first round if the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> runs its own candidate. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> is considering nominating Konrad Adenauer, mayor of Köln and member of the Prussian state legislature. He calls for an alliance of conservative Christian democrats that encompasses both Catholics and Protestants. The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> might nominate Otto Gessler, former defense minister, who has crossover appeal to conservatives in the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and other parties who dislike the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> front.

As for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, we could support a joint <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Coalition candidate or run our own.
[? if braun_campaign : Otto Braun is tired. He ran and failed in the previous two presidential elections, and no longer wishes to run. His wife is ill enough that he wishes to stay by her side. ?][? if braun_campaign = 0 and not spd_prussia: Otto Braun is tired. After being deposed in Prussia, he has largely retired from politics, and is devoting his time to caring for his dying wife. ?][? if braun_campaign = 0 and spd_prussia : Otto Braun is tired. He does not wish to run, but he is willing to be convinced that he is needed at this moment. His wife is terminally ill, and he does not want more responsibilities. ?]
Kurt Schumacher is an ambitious rising star in the party, and would be all too willing to run. He was a hero in the Great War, but his relatively young age might be relevant.
[? if womens_rights >= 6 and family_law >= 2 and womens_work >= 2 and welfare > 0: Or, perhaps it is time for a woman to become president. Germany and the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> have been leading on women's rights for years, and it is only fitting that we should elect the world's first female president. Perhaps Marie Juchacz could be seen as the "mother of the nation" for her work in social welfare. However, her divorce 28 years ago might make it difficult for the Catholics to support her. ?]

[? if presidential_powers >= 1 and pro_republic >= 60 and pacifism >= 3: Since Germany has been largely democratized and presidential powers reduced, we can also support another non-traditional political figure, someone from the cultural, scientific, or literary spheres. They will perhaps be the symbol of a new Germany that has moved beyond its past. ?]
# if Otto Braun ran last time: he can only run if he controls Prussia. Otherwise, it's Kurt Schumacher.

# options: 
# - Otto Braun (only if spd_prussia)
# - Kurt Schumacher
# - Marie Juchacz (The mother of the nation, only available if women's rights is full)

Since the presidency has been made a largely ceremonial figure by our reforms, we might set a precedent by nominating a nonpartisan pro-democracy figure from the cultural, scientific, or literary worlds. There are many potential candidates...

- @einstein_r1: Albert Einstein, physicist.
- @mann_r1: Heinrich Mann, left-wing writer.
- @ossietzky_r1: Carl von Ossietzky, pacifist journalist.

Albert Einstein is a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, and international advocate for peace. He was a founding member of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">German Democratic Party</span> ([? if dstp_formed: whose successor would support him in the election?][? if not dstp_formed: who will support him in the election?]), but has also expressed sympathy towards <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>.

He did not wish to run for president, disliking the public nature of campaigning, but we have somehow convinced him that his candidacy will be crucial to the future of Germany and the world. As a <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jewish</span> German pacifist, his becoming president would be a repudiation of everything the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> stand for.

The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> will endorse Einstein's candidacy.

Heinrich Mann is a world-renowned novelist and poet who is also known to be a left-wing activist. His political sympathy lies with the <span style="color: #700000;">far left</span>, and he supported the revolutions in 1918 and 1919. He has long lived in the shadow of his better-known brother, Thomas Mann.

Mann is willing to accept the nomination for president.

Carl von Ossietzky is a left-wing journalist who is the publisher of the Weltbühne, a news magazine.

In the 1932 presidential election, he endorsed the <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span> Thälmann.

Ossietzky is extremely reluctant to become a politician, and has been an iconoclastic figure his entire life, criticizing the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> as being part of the establishment. It is with a sense of irony that he accepts our nomination.

The bourgeois and right-wing parties are up in arms about the prospect of a <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span> president, although Münzenberg and the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> conciliators take pains to assure Germany of their commitment to the democratic republic. There is no energy for a coup against the new president. The bourgeoisie will have to live with whatever comes.

After its electoral defeat, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> coalition is collapsing into infighting and financial insolvency. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>'s moment has seemingly ended, at least for now.
