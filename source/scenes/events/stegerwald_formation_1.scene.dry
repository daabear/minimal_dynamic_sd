= <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> Reformation

As the newly elected chairman of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, Adam Stegerwald has been working to expand the party's reach in Protestant areas and quell opposition against his agenda. As a trade union leader himself, he has sizable influence over the Christian labor movement, which is already well-connected through entrenched network of alliances with various right-wing organizations. [? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": Cooperation between the various Christian labor unions have been heightened, and together, they are taking down our long-held dominance over the interests of the working-class. ?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": However, Hugenberg of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> maintains strict oversight of its <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Socialist</span> wing, and will not tolerate any cooperation, making the process considerably more challenging without support of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> affiliated unions. Furthermore, Hugenberg's inaction as the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> loses its main voter base is fueling significant internal turmoil over the party's future direction. ?]

This has led to concerns from the labor wing of our party, as we can't afford to lose support of the largest demographic to the bourgeois.

- @fightback_working: We will increase our campaigning towards the working class.
- @fightback_other: We will increase our campaigning towards other demographics to compensate.
- @nothing: Unfortunate.

We increase our messaging among the workers, fighting back against the shift to the right. It isn't enough, but it is something. 

@fightback_other
choose-if: resources >= 1
subtitle: -1 resource.

If the bourgeois wants to appeal to the workers, then we will simply find support elsewhere. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> makes inroads on our inaction. The left of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> is opposed to this path, seeing it as diluting the class character of the party. On the other hand, reformists support branching out to different classes.

The <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> continues to eat into our party's primary voter base.
