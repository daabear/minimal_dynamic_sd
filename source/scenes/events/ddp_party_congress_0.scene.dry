= <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> Reformation

The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> is a fascinating party, plagued by infighting since the republic's foundation and struggling to define its platform in a failed attempt to appeal to voters from all demographics.[? if stolper_program_adopted:&nbsp;Recently, however, the party seems to have turned a new page, rallying around a renewed focus on middle-class interests. ?][? if not stolper_program_adopted:&nbsp;A recent attempt to shift focus toward the middle class has been quietly buried due to internal dissent, perhaps factionalism and personal rivalries may be a permanent feature of this party. ?]

Pessimism is a widespread feeling within the party, leading to mounting pressure on leader Koch-Weser to do "something". After weeks of secret negotiations, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> is announcing the result of a proposed merger of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> and <span style="color: #D3D3A9;">**VNR**</span>, a party admired by senior party officials for its "<span class="tooltip-text" title="good mod">dynamism</span>".

- @dstp_formed: The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DStP**</span> is formed.
- @status_quo: The negotiations fail.

This has come as a complete shock to those inside and outside the party, for the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> to merge with the political wing of a mildly anti-Semitic paramilitary group "Young German Order". Ongoing negotiations to unite the liberal and bourgeois parties has been considerably damaged, due to the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span>'s attempts to promote a left-wing split from the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>.

In this agreement, the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> has promised a "extension of the party to the right", which can only spell trouble for our closest bourgeois ally. Despite this, the formation of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DStP**</span> wasn't a simple left-right divide within the party, the Social Republican Circle and labor leader Ernst Lemmer helps prevent a major split among the left. However, cracks are already beginning to show within this arrangement, it is only a matter of time before this experiment falls apart.

go-to: recalculate

As expected, a merger between an moderately anti-Semitic organization and a party seen as the party for the <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span> has failed, with the Young German Order leader Artur Mahraun leaving negotiations citing irreconcilable differences.

However, internal opposition to Koch-Weser has reached a boiling point. Forces within the party are now pushing for his retirement due to his failure to revive the party and for jeopardizing the negotiations for a <span style="color: #FFCC00;">united liberal party</span>.
