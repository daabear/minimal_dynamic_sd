= 1929 <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> Conference

The transformation of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> into an interconfessional party is now set in stone, but Stegerwald has made himself some enemies in doing so. Conservative Catholics have jumped ship [? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": to the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": to the various right-wing parties that claim to have Catholic interests at heart.?] The left of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> under Joseph Wirth has become a thorn in Stegerwald's side due to his antipathy towards the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

The reformation of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> away from its confessional roots has injected a dose of <span class="tooltip-text" title="good mod">dynamism</span> into the party, making it more willing to change and evolve with current conditions. Jakob Kaiser is a rising star on the left, <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Socialist</span> wing of the party, supporting Stegerwald's vision for a united Christian union but disagreeing with his right-wing policies. 

- @stegerwald: The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> elects Adam Stegerwald as the party chair.
- @kaiser: Influence the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> to select Jakob Kaiser as the party chair.
- @kaiser_campaign: We will hold a campaign in support of Jakob Kaiser as party chair.

Stegerwald will continue to evolve the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> into a Christian, democratic, German, and social party. Hopefully, Joseph Wirth and the left wing of the party will be able to keep him in check. [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": However, the party will continue shifting to the right as it takes the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>'s place on the German right. ?]

With our grassroots connections, we are able to secure the election of Jakob Kaiser to the chairmanship of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>. This has come as a complete shock to the political landscape, which has been shifting to the right recently. His progressive, left-wing views on contentious subjects like nationalizations and his vehement anti-<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span> are ahead of his time. 

Despite this victory, he finds himself at odds with the rest of his party, as his views are out of place. [? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": Furthermore, this has stopped the flow of <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> moderates to the party, whose voters will head back to the [? if not kvp_formed: various smaller parties between the two parties?][? if kvp_formed: the <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>?]. ?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Moderate": Furthermore, this has stopped the process of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> taking over the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> of being the party of the right. ?] Due to the party's <span class="tooltip-text" title="good mod">dynamism</span>, he may be deposed if he proves to be too divisive.
