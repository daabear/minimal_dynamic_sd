The presidential election is coming up soon.

A victory for Hitler would mean the end of parliamentary democracy, and the beginning of an era of <span style="color: #440a0a;">unspeakable</span> <span style="color: #220303;">**horrors**</span>. ?][? if hitler_deported==1 : Since Hitler has been deported, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> will run Hermann Göring in his stead. He is widely seen as a proxy for Hitler, who, despite his legal persecution, retains a popular base who wishes to see him returned to Germany. Meanwhile, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> will run Ernst Thälmann. A victory for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> would mean the end of parliamentary democracy, and the beginning of an era of <span style="color: #7e0000;">**unspeakable**</span> <span style="color: #3f0000;">**horrors**</span>.?]

# if hitler is deported, who would nsdap run? Duesterberg? or Goering?
# Goering runs, essentially as a proxy for Hitler, who is now stateless.

Many are calling for us to support the incumbent Hindenburg, despite his well-known <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> tendencies. Is he truly the best bulwark against Hitler's ascension? On the other hand, many in our party are calling for Otto Braun to run again, but he is reluctant.

[? if kpd_relation >= 50 : Another strange possibility is an united front with the <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span>, either to support Thälmann or our own candidate. ?]

It takes effort to run a somewhat unexpected campaign. First, Braun has to be convinced to run. He himself had supported voting for Hindenburg, and it takes a good deal of prodding to convince him of his destiny.

As expected, the incumbent Hindenburg wins the presidency. Let's hope he continues to keep the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> out of power.

@thalmann_wins
on-arrival: president = "Thälmann"; kpd_relation = 80;

Ernst Thälmann of the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> has won the presidency. Immediately, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> launches a coup attempt against the government. We have no choice but to unite with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> against the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>...

- @civil_war: This is civil war.

[? if nsdap_candidate == "Hitler" : Adolf Hitler of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> has won the presidency. He wastes no time in consolidating power. ?]
[? if nsdap_candidate != "Hitler" : The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> candidate [+ president +] has won. The first action President [+ president +] takes is inviting Hitler back into Germany, and appointing him chancellor. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> waste no time in consolidating power. ?]
