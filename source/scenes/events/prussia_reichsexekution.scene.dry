= Prussian Government Dismissed

President [+ president +] has invoked the *Reichsexekution* to dismiss the Prussian government, citing its "ungovernable" state caused by the repeated failure to form a functioning government amidst escalating clashes between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, Reichsbanner, and other paramilitary groups. 

Although the action has decent justification behind it, rumor has it that President [+ president +] will install a <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> conservative as *Reichskommissar* for the foreseeable future.

Hindenburg appoints the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> Franz von Papen to govern over Prussia as a *Reichskommissar*, charged with dismantling the democratic systems we worked hard to build.

Future state elections have been postponed indefinitely, to be held only when the situation is deemed "stable enough."
