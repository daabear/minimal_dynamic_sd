= <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> Congress

The internal dissent within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> has risen again with conflict over their participation in the referendum against the Young Plan[? if was_in_right_coalition == 1:&nbsp;and their withdrawal from the government[? if spd_in_government == 1:&nbsp;leaving us in power?]?]. 

The "unity of the no" against <span style="color: #9B0000;">Marxism</span> has been losing its force over the years, and now is the time for the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> to define itself through the next challenging years. [? if young_plan_signatures >= 10: The success of the Young Plan referendum to reach the adequate signatures has bolstered the current leadership.?][? if weimar_ref_signatures >= 30: The high support for the referendum for the revision of the constitution has bolstered the current leadership.?]

Despite some dissent from the more <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span> forces within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, the congress goes through without incident. The willingness of their leadership to negotiate with the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> is certainly concerning.

[? if stegerwald_path: As a result of Stegerwald capturing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>'s working-class voters, the party is refocusing to reach out to Catholics. ?]

The exodus of workers from our support base has greatly strengthened the <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Socialists</span> within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, who seek to take advantage of our alienation of the trade unions. 

Walther Lambach has been elected leader of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, a trade union leader and the center of discourse within their party in the last congress. He claims a middle ground between socialism and capitalism, and to reconcile capital and labor, it remains to be seen how his leadership would impact the political landscape.

The reluctance for the party around Hergt and Westarp to fully commit to a democratic party has been increasingly under fire from the <span style="color: #6D5298;">Christian Socialists</span> and "Young Conservatives", and [? if young_plan_signatures < 10 and pro_republic_8 < 70: the failure for the referendum against the Young Plan to reach the signature threshold has tipped the balance in their favor?][? if weimar_ref_signatures < 30 and pro_republic_8 >= 70: the underperformance of the referendum for the revision of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> constitution has tipped the balance in their favor?][? if (was_in_center_right_coalition == 1 and pro_republic_8 >= 70 and pro_republic >= 70) and not (weimar_ref_signatures < 30 and pro_republic_8 >= 70) and not (young_plan_signatures < 10 and pro_republic_8 < 70): the national opinion increasingly shifting in favor of <span style="color: #000000;">rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ub</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">lic</span>?]. 

Gottfried Treviranus has been elected as leader of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>, a member of the "Young Conservative" faction and is supportive of transforming the party into a positive, progressive conservative force, akin to the <span style="color: #0087DC;">British Tories</span>. The defeat of the radical right and national conservative forces within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> helps pave the way for Treviranus' vision of a <span style="color: #87CEFA;">Christian Democratic</span> party.
