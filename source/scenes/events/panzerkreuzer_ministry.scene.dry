= Panzerkreuzer

Navy leaders are asking for the construction of a new battlecruiser, as promised by the previous government. Since we control the Reichswehr ministry, it is our decision as to whether to build the battlecruiser or not.

- @vote_yes: Build the battlecruiser.
- @vote_no: Do not build the battlecruiser.

We have pleased the military by supporting the construction of the battlecruiser. However, our grassroots party members are shocked by our intransigence! Many party branches have begun agitating against the Reichstag delegation.

Military leaders are upset at the Ministry's decision to not construct the battlecruiser, and they have taken the complaints to our coalition partners and President Hindenburg. However, there is not much they can do to force the construction, as we have control over the Reichswehr ministry.

No matter what, the battlecruiser will not be built. We have fulfilled one of our campaign promises, and our supporters are pleased.
