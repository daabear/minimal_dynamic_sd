= Coup in Prussia

A crisis! Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has ordered the dismissal of the Prussian government in a procedure known as the *Reichsexekution*. His argument is that the Prussian state government is unable to maintain order due to the battles on the streets between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, Reichsbanner, and other paramilitaries. This is despite his own government legalizing them.

The legality of the action is questionable. Many of our members are ready to resist.

The Reichswehr and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> are already surrounding Berlin, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is supporting them. This could be civil war. We do realize that, correct? 

- @defend_2: We will fight, even if it leads to a civil war.

Our forces confront the government troops and their <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> auxiliaries, and somehow, our enemies retreat without a fight! They were overwhelmed by our display of strength, and have chosen to slink away. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] withdraws the dismissal of the Prussian government, at least for now.

The show of force has reinvigorated support for the republic and for the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, and has weakened the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>.

@defend_2_civil_war

Our forces confront the government troops and their supporters on the streets of Berlin, and armed fighting erupts. The <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span> do not budge from their positions. We are caught at a disadvantage.

- @civil_war: It is a civil war.

A pall of hopelessness and despair descends over <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democracy</span>. We have failed. Many in the Reichsbanner simply quit, demoralized by their leaders' lack of a call to action.

Hindenburg appoints the <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span> Franz von Papen to govern over Prussia as a *Reichskommissar*, who will focus on dismantling the democratic systems we worked hard to build.
