= Act for the Protection of the Economy and Finance

To fully eliminate the national budget deficit, Brüning has introduced an act featuring spending cuts alongside a special “crisis tax.” However, [? if hoover_moratorium_seen or reparations == -2: with reparation payments paused, Brüning has been able to implement these austerity measures more leniently than anticipated. ?][? if bourgeois_parliament and not lvp_formed and not (hoover_moratorium_seen or reparations == -2): the bourgeois parliamentary group has used its leverage to force Brüning to tone down his austerity measures. He is compelled to comply; otherwise, he risks angering a majority of the parties supporting his government. ?][? if liberal_parliament and not (hoover_moratorium_seen or reparations == -2): the liberal parliamentary group has used its leverage to force Brüning to tone down his austerity measures. He is compelled to comply; otherwise, he risks angering the already frustrated <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>. ?][? if lvp_formed and not (hoover_moratorium_seen or reparations == -2): the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> has used its leverage over the government to force Brüning to tone down his austerity measures, at for the middle class.?][? if bourgeois_parliament and not lvp_formed and (hoover_moratorium_seen or reparations == -2): Furthermore, the bourgeois parliamentary group has used its leverage to force Brüning to further tone down his austerity measures. He is compelled to comply; otherwise, he risks angering a majority of the parties supporting his government. ?][? if liberal_parliament and (hoover_moratorium_seen or reparations == -2): Furthermore, the liberal parliamentary group has used its leverage to force Brüning to tone down his austerity measures.

Despite being less severe than expected, the act has sparked widespread outrage, fueling the attacks from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> against the bourgeois parties, pressuring them to break with Brüning over the matter. The [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> are?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> is?] particularly affected, as they're the [? if not lvp_formed:parties?][? if lvp_formed:party?] representing the social groups most impacted by these changes. Brüning's failure to consult [? if not lvp_formed:either party?][? if lvp_formed:them?] before introducing the bill has left the [? if not lvp_formed:liberal parties?][? if lvp_formed: liberals?] powerless to amend some of the most severe provisions, such as cuts to civil servants' salaries and an increase in the national sales tax.

With the bourgeois-right holding a majority coalition, it is now up to them to resolve their differences if they wish to prevent their government from collapsing.

The more radical anti-Brüning factions within the [? if not lvp_formed:<span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed:<span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> initially pushed to break with Brüning, threatening to vote against the act. However, the strong pro-Brüning faction—including figures like Westarp, Curtius, and influential industrialists such as Hans Luther—managed to sway their colleagues, arguing the act is a necessary, albeit painful, step to stabilize Germany’s economy. Their confidence in Brüning was further restored by the fact that the measures were not as severe as initially feared.

As a result, the planned vote of no confidence has been shelved, allowing the bourgeois-right government to survive—at least for now.
