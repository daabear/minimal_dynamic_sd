= Second <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> Party Congress

The merger of two notoriously factionalized parties has unsurprisingly introduced great dysfunction into the internal politics of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Not even a unifying figure like Hans Luther has been able to quell the endless bickering among the party's factions. The economic depression has only deepened these divisions, with disagreements arising even on broadly supported issues like parliamentary government, making unified action nearly impossible.

[? if chancellor == "Brüning" and not spd_in_government: The <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> has shifted significantly to the right due to their participation in [? if in_right_coalition: Brüning's center-right coalition?][? if not in_right_coalition: Brüning's emergency government?]. This election will be pivotal in determining their policy of cooperation with us in the foreseeable future.?] While Hans Luther is expected to secure re-election, scattered candidates from across the party could emerge if the majority loses confidence in Luther's leadership.

Hans Luther is expectedly re-elected as the leader of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. He will navigate the party through the economic depression and will hopefully try to maintain bourgeois backing for the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> system, but there is only so much he can do.

Surprisingly, Luther has failed to command the majority of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> behind his candidacy. Following this result, Luther has resigned from his chairmanship and now endorses [+ luther_endorsed_candidate +] for the leadership race, however his endorsement fails to sway much delegates into his favor. Luther has now taken up a position as the President of the Reichsbank, still holding some sway over party affairs.

Theodor Heuss, a rising star and former member of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span>. Backed primarily by the 'Social Republican Circle,' composed of former <span style="color: #D3C24D;">[+ ddp_name +]</span> members and liberal intellectuals and newspapers, Heuss has also garnered support from the broader party due to his decently conservative stances on economic and national issues.

Heuss's victory empowers the '<span style="color: #c00000;">Social</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Rep</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">ubl</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ican</span>' wing, strengthening our cooperation. Despite his personal leanings toward the right, Heuss remains one of the most committed and genuine supporters for <span style="color: #FFCC00;">liberal</span> <span style="color: #586593;">democracy</span> within the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>.

Hermann Dietrich, formerly affiliated with the business wing of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, has been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Dietrich is mainly supported by smaller businesses and ruralites, and [? if chancellor == "Brüning" and not spd_in_government: is known for formulating Brüning's emergency decrees during his tenure as Finance Minister.?][? if not (chancellor == "Brüning" and not spd_in_government): is known for his fiscal conservatism.?]

Despite this, Dietrich is not as extreme as the industrialists on the right of the party and remains open to cooperation with us if there is no other majority. However, his leadership has been quite uninspiring, to say the least. [? if agriculture_minister_party == "LVP" or economic_minister_party == "LVP": The responsibilities of his ministry prevent him from being involved in the day-to-day running of his party, which is now delegated to a group of his associates in the business wing. ?]

view-if: curtius_lead

Julius Curtius, Stresemann's successor in foreign affairs and a former member of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, has won the vote to succeed Luther for the chairmanship. Curtius is supported by the 'Pragmatic Center', and was put forth as a compromise candidate. 

As a former member of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s left wing, he is in favor of closer cooperation with us. However, his leadership has been quite uninspiring, to say the least. [? if foreign_minister_party == "LVP": The responsibilities of the foreign ministry prevent him from being involved in the day-to-day running of his party, which is now delegated to a group of his associates in the 'Pragmatic Center'. ?]

Eduard Dingeldey, previously part of the movement for bourgeois unity, has now been elected chairman of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Dingeldey is backed by the industrial forces on the right of the party, alongside former <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> members. He appears to be focused on fostering closer cooperation with the array of parties between the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span> and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.

However, Dingeldey has thus far proven to be an ineffectual leader, often capitulating to the right wing of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>. Recently, we’ve observed a deterioration in relations with his party, alongside a noticeable rightward shift in the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>'s internal politics.

The vote has been deadlocked, with no candidate ahead by enough to constitute a majority. You, the player, now has free will to choose a compromise candidate. Spend it wisely.
