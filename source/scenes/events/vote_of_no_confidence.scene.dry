How do we assuage our partners?

Letting the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> into the Prussian government is an offer too good for them to refuse, no matter their leadership. 

However, this has negatively impacted our freedom of action we previously had in the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> coalition.

Fine. We no longer control the government of Prussia. The vote has been called off.

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is not interested in a "toleration" arrangement; they will only support us if they can participate in the government as part of a coalition. And, if this toleration agreement happens, the right-wing parties will not be inclined to support us.

The vote succeeds, and our government has resigned. Chancellor Brüning has been appointed as the head of a new cabinet, consisting solely of the bourgeois parties. He immediately proceeds to cut welfare spending substantially.

[? if not bruning_event_seen and year >= 1930: New elections haven't been called yet but it's likely that they will be soon, considering Brüning most likely doesn't have the majority of the Reichstag behind him. ?]
