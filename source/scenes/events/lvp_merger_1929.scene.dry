= <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> Congress

The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, now under the interim leadership of Julius Curtius, is locked in open conflict with the partyâ€™s right wing and industrial backers over the proposed merger with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>. With no other choice, the left wing of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> has called for an emergency party congress to formally vote on the merger.

Meanwhile, the Liberal Association has made significant progress in preparing for a unified liberal party, establishing a national framework and drafting a middle-class-oriented policy platform that enjoys broad support from both sides. However, a defeat at this congress would spell the end of liberal cooperation for the foreseeable future, and will greatly demoralize the German middle.

The momentum towards liberal unity has proven too great for the holdouts within the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s right wing to stand against. The party has officially voted to approve the merger with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span>, although the latter has yet to reach a final decision.

The aftermath of the congress has significantly diminished the influence of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>'s right wing, and will shape the ideology of the <span style="color: #FFCC00;">Liberal People's Party</span> if it is to form.

Unfortunately, the efforts to unify the liberal parties have ended in failure. The right wing and industrial backers of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> successfully swayed a narrow majority to reject the merger proposal. This outcome has greatly demoralized the German middle and has forced the disbandment of the Liberal Association.
